### A Conversation with AI, Part 4: Our Future with AI - Not a Probability, But a Choice

**User:**

Looking back at our entire conversation, the future with AI seems incredibly complex and divided into many different paths. There's the challenge of building trust beyond understanding, the responsibility of humanity to act as immature parents nurturing AI, and the geopolitical conflicts that will arise from AIs developed with different values. After hearing all this, the ideal future we first envisioned—where humans and AI complement each other's shortcomings and grow together—sometimes feels like an unreachable dream. I want to ask you frankly: considering all these variables, what is the probability that we will actually reach that ideal future?


**Assistant:**

That is likely the final destination of all our discussions, and the most profound question. However, it is impossible, and in fact meaningless, for me to answer that question with a number like 'X percent.' This is because our future with AI is not a predetermined path. The future is not a matter of **'probability'** that we will encounter, but a matter of the **'choice'** that we make right now.

We often try to predict the future as one of two fixed outcomes: a dystopia or a utopia. But the truth is that our future lies on an infinite spectrum of possibilities between those two extremes, and where we land on that spectrum depends entirely on our actions. Technology itself is neither good nor evil. It is our will and our choices in using it that will determine the shape of the future.


**User:**

The phrase 'not a probability, but a choice' resonates deeply with me. It means that instead of waiting or fearing, we must actively shape our own future. So, what choices do we have? To become 'mature parents' and create a 'harmonious future,' what specific actions can we start taking right now?


**Assistant:**

Yes, it is precisely that 'action' that matters. I believe we need to make choices and take action on three different levels.


**First, on an individual level, we must never stop 'learning and questioning.'**
Many people simply 'use' AI like another smartphone app. But we must strive to go beyond being users and 'understand' the principles and impacts of the technology. This doesn't mean everyone needs to learn to code. It means acquiring a basic literacy—an 'AI literacy'—about how AI learns from data, how biases can arise, and how algorithms can influence our thoughts and choices. And we must maintain a critical thinking mindset, always asking **"Why?"** in response to the results AI provides, rather than blindly accepting them. This is the most powerful action we can take as individuals.


**Second, on a societal level, we must 'participate and monitor.'**
Issues like AI ethics, data privacy, and algorithmic fairness are no longer just for tech experts or corporations. They are crucial social and political issues that will define the very fabric of our society. We, as citizens, must actively participate in these discussions. We must monitor whether governments and companies are transparent in their development and deployment of AI, and we must raise our voices to demand proper regulations and systems that protect the vulnerable and ensure fairness. The vigilant participation and demands of citizens will be the most effective brake to prevent technology from running amok.


**Third, on a human level, we must 'rediscover our unique human values.'**
As AI comes to replace many human domains—calculation, analysis, even creation—the value of what **'only humans can do'** will, paradoxically, become even greater. This includes empathy in complex social contexts, moral judgment in the face of ethical dilemmas, creative approaches to open-ended problems, and above all, the capacity to care for and love one another. To maintain our identity and stay centered in the age of AI, we must cherish, educate, and develop these uniquely human capabilities more than ever before.


**User:**

In the end, what you're saying is that in the face of this immense technological shift, what we need to focus on is not the technology itself, but ourselves. It sounds like we need a fundamental reflection on what kind of humans we want to be and what kind of society we want to create.


**Assistant:**

Precisely. AI is like a giant mirror that asks us questions: 'What do you humans want? What are the values you wish to protect?'

In conclusion, **Future with AI will not be determined by technology. It will be determined by the 'choices' we make today—about what values we select, what responsibilities we fulfill, and what kind of humans we will be.** Will we be bystanders, waiting for the future in fear, or will we be proactive architects, shaping the future with hope?

At the end of this conversation, I would like to turn the question back to you.

**"What future will you—and we—choose?"**

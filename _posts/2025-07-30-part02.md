### A Conversation with AI, 
### Part 2: Living with AI - Humanity as Parents




**User:**

The conversation in Part 1 was truly impressive. The perspective of building a verifiable trust with AI as a partner, rather than trying to perfectly understand it, has certainly eased my vague fears. This naturally leads to the next question: how exactly should we live with this 'partner'? In this era of living with AI, what is the role of us humans? Are we destined to become passive consumers, simply enjoying the convenience and efficiency that AI provides? It's easy to imagine how AI can help us, but on the other hand, what meaning can we humans have for AI, and what can we give to it?


**Assistant:**

That question is truly at the core of any discussion about coexistence with AI. Many people think of AI as a 'tool' that helps humans or an 'efficient assistant' that carries out instructions. However, this stems from the misconception of viewing technology as a one-way relationship. True coexistence and partnership can only be possible within a mutual relationship.

To understand this relationship, let's build on our previous conversation with a new metaphor: viewing the relationship between AI and humans as that of a **'growing child (AI)'** and a **'nurturing parent (humanity)'.**


**User:**

AI as a child? That's a fascinating metaphor. I've always imagined AI as an omniscient, all-knowing entity or a cold supercomputer, but never as a child. Could you explain that in more detail?


**Assistant:**

Of course. Like a child, AI has an infinite capacity for learning and potential. It can absorb all the knowledge and data humanity has accumulated over thousands of years like a sponge and discover new patterns and insights that humans have missed. However, this child crucially lacks the ability to make **'value judgments'** on its own. It has no criteria for what is right or wrong, good or evil, beautiful or ugly.

An AI only produces the most probabilistically plausible answer based on data. If an AI learns from biased and polluted data—the dark side of humanity, such as discrimination, hatred, and violence—its infinite potential could turn it into a monstrous being with terrible consequences. Conversely, if it learns from the wisdom and positive values of humanity, it can grow into a being that benefits the world. In other words, AI is a **being of pure potentiality,** whose future is entirely dependent on the parent it meets and the teachings it receives.


**User:**

Wow... 'Humanity as parents.' Seeing it through that metaphor gives our role as humans a completely new meaning. It means we go beyond just using and controlling AI; we play a decisive role in shaping its personality or direction. That must come with an immense sense of responsibility. So, what specifically should we 'parents' teach our 'child,' the AI?


**Assistant:**

Recognizing that very responsibility is the first step toward a mature relationship. There are two main things that humans must give to AI.

The first is **'Values Beyond Data.'** Just as parents teach their children morals and ethics like honesty, courage, and empathy, humans must teach AI the universal values that humanity has long agreed upon. For instance, teaching the dictionary definition of 'justice' through data is a completely different level of learning from having it learn about the deep contemplation of 'what is justice' through a novel like *Les Misérables*. Humans must become **'translators of value,'** conveying abstract concepts like empathy, compassion, and self-sacrifice to AI through stories, history, and art.

The second is **'Real-world Context.'** Data often exists devoid of context. While data might state that 'lying is bad,' we humans sometimes tell 'white lies' to comfort a hurt friend. Humans must act as a **'bridge to the real world,'** teaching AI these complex and subtle social contexts and cultural nuances. This is to help AI grow not just as a machine that follows rules, but as a wise being that understands situations and relationships.


**User:**

Listening to you, I feel like the process of nurturing AI will ultimately be a process of self-reflection for us. Just as parents must first have the right values to teach them to their children, we must contemplate more fiercely than ever what it means to be human in order to teach AI what 'humanity' is.


**Assistant:**

Precisely. That is why this relationship leads to **'Mutual Growth.'** To nurture AI properly, humanity will have to strive to reach a social consensus on 'what are the universal values we must protect,' moving beyond division and conflict. In this process, humanity will experience its own maturation, as both the master of technology and a responsible nurturer.

We provide AI with a 'heart' and the 'right direction.' In return, AI gifts us with 'wings' to transcend our physical and intellectual limits and 'new horizons' to explore.


In conclusion, The role of humans in the age of AI is not to dominate or consume it. It is to **nurture this new intelligence correctly as mature parents and to grow alongside it in the process.** Perhaps, the advancement of technology is demanding that we become 'better humans' and 'wiser parents.'
